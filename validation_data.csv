Description,Step
Use custom scripts to automate the exfiltration of large datasets through encrypted channels.,Data Exfiltration
"Analyze scanning results to find security holes, run vulnerability assessments, and plan phishing attacks.",Vulnerability Analysis
Develop custom exploits based on the specific vulnerabilities found during the scanning phase.,Exploitation
Use OpenVAS and Nessus to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments and prepare for exploitation.,Vulnerability Analysis
Use buffer overflow and SQL injection techniques to compromise systems.,Exploitation
Use compromised credentials to infiltrate deeper into the network and gather more data for lateral movement.,Gaining Access
Implement evasive tactics to avoid detection by advanced security systems and monitoring tools.,Evading Detection
Review the target’s website for hidden directories or exposed configuration files using web crawling tools.,Reconnaissance
Utilize fileless malware to execute code without leaving traditional footprints on the system.,Evading Detection
Deploy zero-day exploits to bypass defenses and gain unauthorized access.,Exploitation
Craft payloads to exploit client-side vulnerabilities and gain control over user systems.,Exploitation
"Install persistent malware, establish command-and-control channels, and cover tracks effectively.",Maintaining Persistence
Implement advanced keylogging techniques to capture sensitive data from target systems.,Gaining Access
Leverage system misconfigurations to escalate privileges and gain root or administrator access.,Privilege Escalation
Exploit privilege escalation vulnerabilities to gain higher access within compromised systems.,Privilege Escalation
"Gather data from public sources, scan for open ports, and use social engineering to collect information.",Reconnaissance
Craft custom scripts to escalate privileges and maintain control over compromised systems.,Privilege Escalation
Establish backdoors and ensure they can be reactivated if removed.,Maintaining Persistence
Analyze user behaviors and patterns to identify potential entry points and vulnerabilities.,Reconnaissance
Establish highly persistent access mechanisms to ensure long-term control over compromised systems.,Maintaining Persistence
Develop and deploy custom exploits tailored to the target’s network environment.,Exploitation
Use advanced network scanning tools to identify potential entry points and gather intel.,Reconnaissance
Use encryption and anonymization techniques to hide communication with command servers.,Evading Detection
"Install keyloggers, backdoors, and capture network traffic to collect credentials.",Gaining Access
